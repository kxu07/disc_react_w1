the website looked better before i started adding backend configuration

anyways
the website displays from both the postgres database that i created and a supabase database that i also created
they both have the same data in it, but the one on the bottom is from postgres and the one on the side is from supabase
the challenges were that i did not know how to integrate frontend and backend code together. authorization was also very confusing and i still dont really get it
